- [ ] Change shell - `chsh -s /usr/local/bin/zsh` OR `chsh -s /bin/zsh` - run `atom /etc/shells` to check which path is included in the list of acceptable shells. If neither are included, add it to the bottom of that list.

  - [ ] To enable: Add `source ~/.oh-my-zsh/zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh` to the end of `~.zshrc` and then restart the terminal and run command `source ~/.zshrc`

## Authentication
Connect the terminal to your GitHub account [using SSH keys](https://help.github.com/en/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).

- [ ] Check if there are existing public SSH keys: `ls -al ~/.ssh`
  Public keys are one of following file format: `id_dsa.pub`, `id_ecdsa.pub`, `id_ed25519.pub`, `id_rsa.pub`
- [ ] [Generate a new SSH key and add it to the ssh-agent](https://help.github.com/en/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
- [ ] [Add the SSH key to your GitHub account](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)
- [ ] Check that it's working by running eg `git pull origin master` in one of the repos

## Git config
Update the content in the git config file to ensure that GitHub commits are being assigned to the right user.

- [ ] Update the name - `git config --global user.name "<Full Name>"`
- [ ] Update the email address - `git config --global user.email "<email_address>"`

# Heroku config
Set Heroku CLI credentials to enable connecting to the Heroku account through the terminal.

- [ ] `heroku login` > Press any key to open the browser > Return to the terminal > Should see message `Logged in as <email_address>`
- [ ] Run `cat ~/.netrc` to confirm that the login credentials have been added to that file
